# Weekend Practice session

These weekend exercises are designed to help you level up in various areas, particularly algorithms and Object Oriented Programming. We *strongly* encourage you to complete these exercises over the weekend. We've tried to keep them brief but powerful. On Sunday, we'll review the solutions to the exercises from that week.

## Algorithms

These problems are designed to help you practice becoming a fluent programmer. They are short and sweet, much like the types of questions you will be asked in a job interview.

You shouldn't be very concerned with getting the "right" answer as fast as possible. Rather, you should focus on improving with each problem. If it takes you a while to remember the syntax for writing a method or looping through a list, keep practicing and focusing on those skills. With enough practice, it will become second nature.

## OOP

Object Oriented Programming is one of the most fundamental skills as a programmer, and you'll want to get really good at it. These exercises will help you get there. 

## Usage

Each problem has driver code at the bottom so you can test your solution by running the code in Sublime (Command + B). Alternatively, you can run each file from the terminal as well.
